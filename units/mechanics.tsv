FACTION	NAME	DESCRIPTION
C.A.R.C.A.S.S.	Formation	While adjacent to an ally, gain +1D on attacks.
C.A.R.C.A.S.S.	Reload	Once used, a unit cannot use any ability with this tag until it reload. To reload, sacrifice a MOVE. Other abilities may allow a reload for free.
C.A.R.C.A.S.S.	Headshot	Effect that triggers when rolling a 6 on the final attack roll.
Goregrinders	Blood Rage	If a unit with this trait is reduced to 0 hp, they are not slain, but instead gain 1 strength and remain at 0 hp, no matter how much damage they took. If they take any further damage at 0 hp, they are slain as normal.
Goregrinders	Berserk	After a berserk unit ACTs, it splashes (self) 1 damage, then discards a berserk token. If this effect does not damage any other characters, it deals 1 damage to itself instead, ignoring armor. Berserk counts as a positive and a negative token.
Goregrinders	Retaliation	After any ability resolves that damages this unit, this unit deals 1 damage back to the ability's owner, even if this unit was slain.
Gargamox	Plague	Units affected by plague take 1 toxic damage at the end of their turn, then that unit discards a plague token. This damage cannot be reduced or ignored in any way (by tokens or armor) but cannot slay a unit. Gargamox units don't take damage from plague and don't remove plague tokens, but can still be affected by plague.
Gargamox	Infect	Jumps from the original target up to three times to up to three different characters, as long as each character is in range 2 of the previous character.
Gargamox	Death Burst	Effect that triggers when this unit is slain.
Deadsouls	Doom	Any unit affected by at least one Doom token takes 6 devil damage at the end of round 4. A unit can clear a Doom token by slaying another unit or by clearing negative tokens as normal.
Deadsouls	Isolation	Gains extra effects against units with no allies adjacent.
Abhorrers	Miracle	A unit affected by a Miracle has a 5+ effect chance to instantly return to life at 1 hp at the end of any turn it is slain.
Abhorrers	Stance	An ability with stance gains different effect on odd, even, or special numbered round.
Igorri	Spare Parts	If an ability has spare parts, the unit may absorb any number of adjacent corpses at the start of this ability to grant it additional effects, removing those corpses.
Igorri	Mutate	When a unit mutates, it gains a mutation token. Mutation tokens can be discarded instead of discarding any other other token. Mutation tokens can be a stand-in and act as a 'copy' for any other token, allowing you to keep the original.
